NestJS is designed as a platform-agnostic framework, enabling developers to create reusable components that function seamlessly across various application types and underlying technologies. â€‹

Key Features of NestJS's Platform Agnosticism:

Reusable Components Across HTTP Frameworks: NestJS allows the development of components that can operate with different HTTP server frameworks, such as Express and Fastify, without modification. This flexibility facilitates easy switching between frameworks based on project requirements.

Support for Multiple Application Types: Beyond traditional HTTP servers, NestJS supports various application types, including microservices with diverse transport layers and WebSockets. This versatility enables developers to apply the same architectural patterns across different communication protocols.

GraphQL Integration: NestJS offers a dedicated GraphQL module, allowing developers to choose GraphQL as the API layer instead of or alongside REST APIs. This integration provides flexibility in API design and implementation.

Application Context Feature: With the application context feature, NestJS facilitates the creation of various Node.js applications, including CRON jobs and Command Line Interface (CLI) apps, promoting code reuse and modularity.

By embracing platform agnosticism, NestJS empowers developers to build applications that are adaptable, maintainable, and scalable, adhering to the principle of "build once, use everywhere."
