Explanation:

Singleton Scope (DEFAULT):

The SingletonService is an example of a provider with the default singleton scope. A single instance of this service is created and shared across the entire application. This is suitable for stateless services or services that manage shared resources.​

Request Scope (REQUEST):

The RequestScopedService is marked with Scope.REQUEST, indicating that a new instance is created for each incoming request. This is useful when you need to maintain request-specific state or access the request object directly.​
NestJS Documentation

By injecting the REQUEST object, you can access details of the current request. In this example, the service provides a method to retrieve the request URL.​
NestJS Documentation

Transient Scope (TRANSIENT):

The TransientService is marked with Scope.TRANSIENT, meaning that every consumer of this service will receive a new instance. This is beneficial when you want to ensure that consumers do not share state.​
NestJS Documentation

Controller Scope:

The CatsController is an example of a request-scoped controller. By setting the scope property to Scope.REQUEST, a new instance of the controller is created for each request. This is particularly useful when the controller depends on request-scoped providers.​
NestJS Documentation

In the findAll method, the controller uses the RequestScopedService to access information about the current request, demonstrating how request-scoped services can be utilized within request-scoped controllers.​

Scope Hierarchy:

In NestJS, the scope of providers affects the scope of their consumers:​

If a controller depends on a request-scoped provider, the controller itself becomes request-scoped. For example, since CatsController depends on RequestScopedService, CatsController is also request-scoped.​
NestJS Documentation

Transient providers do not affect the scope of their consumers. Injecting a transient provider into a singleton-scoped service does not change the singleton nature of that service.​
NestJS Documentation

Performance Consideration:

Using request-scoped providers can impact application performance because a new instance is created for each request. Therefore, it's recommended to use the default singleton scope unless request or transient scope is explicitly required.​
NestJS Documentation

This setup allows for flexible management of provider lifetimes, enabling you to tailor the behavior of your services and controllers to the specific needs of your application.​
